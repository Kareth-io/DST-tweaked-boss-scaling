# Tweaked Boss Scaling

[Workshop Link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2414579835)

This mod changes multiple item drop rates, specific to progression. I made this mod mainly so that my newer friends wouldn't have to wait until 4th winter to get an eyebrella if we had a lot of people playing. 

___

## Changed Drops


  * Deerclops Eyeball
  * Bearger Fur
  * Bundling Wrap Blueprint (Beequeen specific)
  * Ancient Guardian Horn
  * Klaus Sack bundles/presents

___

## Formula

The formula is pretty simple. The minimum number of drops you will get will be N/2 where N is the number of currently online players. The maximum number of drops will be the same as N. Any non guaranteed drops have a 40% chance of dropping. So for example, if you have 6 people connected and you kill a Bearger you will have the following loot table.


  * Bearger Fur x3 (100%)
  * Bearger Fur (40%)
  * Bearger Fur (40%)
  * Bearger Fur (40%)
  * Meat x8 (100%)
  * BeargerFigure Sketch (100%)


___

**NOTE:** The number of players that actually impacts the loot tables is cave/overworld specific. So if you want the maximum number of drops from a given boss, ensure you have everyone at least in the same world as the target boss.
